                <h2 class="place">Goa port</h2>
                <p>Perched on a hill overlooking the Arabian Sea, Fort Aguada is one of Goa's iconic landmarks. Built by the Portuguese in the 17th century, this massive fort served as a crucial defense against invaders, guarding the coastline and the mouth of the Mandovi. </p>

                <p>The fort is well-preserved and offers stunning views of the sea and the surrounding landscape. One of its most distinctive features is the four-story lighthouse, which was once the tallest in Asia. A visit to Fort Aguada is a step back in time, offering a glimpse into Goa's rich history while also providing a perfect spot to watch the sunset.</p>
